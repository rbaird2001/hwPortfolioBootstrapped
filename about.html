                    <p class="mx-3"> I live amongst the beauty of the Silicon Slopes. 
                        Living in this area creates a love of the outdoors and all the activities it has to offer. 
                        Nearly all who live here either by birth or migration become attached to the natural variety that exists within arm's reach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mx-3">I especially enjoy hiking, hammock camping, and cycling.
                         <strong>However, nothing beats the joy of swimming.</strong> 
                         I have been an avid swimmer my whole life.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mx-3"> I have traveled the world for business and pleasure. 
                         I've enjoyed extended stays in India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Italy. 
                         What I love the most about travel isn't the sights. 
                         It's the people. Nothing compares to the cultural experience of sitting with 
                         a person in their native land and having them talk about thier home. 
                         If this occurs during a meal prepared in their own home at their table, the experience is unmatchable. 
                         The few opportunities I have had to do this remain my among my greatest memories.
                    </p>
